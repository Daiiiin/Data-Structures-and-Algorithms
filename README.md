# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Codes for DSA, from pre-mid to finals

Written by: Matthew Dave Desabelle

## Pre-midterm Topics

1)  Abstract Data Type (ADT)
2)  ADT List
     ```
     a) Implementations of ADT List:
          1) Array Implementations (4 versions)
          2) Linked List Implementation (Singly Link)
          3) Cursor-based Implementation
      b) Time Complexity of the List operations in different implementations : O(1), O(N), and O(N*N)
      ```
3)  ADT Stack   
    ```
    a) Implementations
          1) Array Implementation (4 versions)
          2) Linked List Implementation
          3) Cursor-based Implementation
    b) Time Complexity:  O(1) and O(N)
    ```
4)  ADT Queue
     ```
     a) Implementations
          1) Linked List Implementation
               > Queue is a pointer to a dynamically allocated node
               > Queue is a structure containing front and rear pointers to dynamically allocated node/s
          2) Circular Array Implementation
               > Solution 1: Add a counter
               > Solution 2:  Queue is full if there are MAX-1 elements where MAX is the size of the array
     b) Time Complexity:  O(1) and O(N)
     ```
## Midterm Topics

1) Set
     ```
     a) ADT UID
          1) Array, Linked list, and cursor-based implementations
          2) Bit-Vector Implementation
          3) Computer Word Implementation
     ```
     ```
     b) ADT Dictionary
          1) Open Hashing (or External hashing)
          2) Close Hashing (or Internal hashin)
     ```
## Pre-Finals
1) ADT Tree
     ```
     a) Tree Traversals [Preorder, Inorder, Postorder]
     b) Implementations
          1) Parent Pointer Implementation
          2) List of Children Implementation
     c) Binary Tree definition and Implementations
     d) Expression Trees
     e) Huffman Code
     ```
2) Binary Search Tree (BST)
     ```
     a) Description and Implementation
     b) Operations: Insert, Delete, and Member
     c) Similarity and Difference between BST and AVL trees
     d) Binary Search vs. Sequential Search
     ```
3) ADT Priority Queue
     ```
     a) Partially Ordered Tree (POT)
     b) Min and Max heap
          > MinHeap ==> Operations: insert and deleteMin
          > MaxHeap ==> Operations: insert and deleteMax
     c) MinHeapify and MaxHeapify
          > Version 1: Insert all elements in an initially empty POT
          > Version 2: Heapify starting with lowest level parent
     ```
4) Heapsort Sorting Technique (in place)
## Finals
1) Directed and Undirected Graph
     ```
     a) Concepts
     b) Graph Implementations: 
          1) Adjacency Matrix
          2) Adjacency List 
     ```
2) Graph Algorithms
     ```
     a) Shortest Paths: Dijkstra’s, Floyd’s, and Warshall’s Algorithms
     b) Traversals: Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS)
     c) Minimum Cost Spanning Tree: Prim’s and Kruskal’s Algorithms
     ```
