codes for DSA, from pre-mid to finals

## Written by: Matthew Dave Desabelle

### Pre-midterm Topics

1)  Abstract Data Type (ADT)
2)  ADT List  return
     a) Implementations of ADT List:
        i) Array Implementation (4 versions)  
           Version 1: List is a structure containing an array and variable count
           Version 2: List is a pointer to a structure containing an array  and variable count
           Version 3: List is a structure containing a pointer to the 1st element of a dynamic array, and variable count
           Version 4: List is a pointer to a structure containing a pointer to the 1st element of a dynamic array, and variable count 
        ii) Linked List Implementation (Singly Link)
       iii) Cursor-based Implementation
       
      b) Time Complexity of the List operations in different implementations : O(1), O(N), and O(N*N)
